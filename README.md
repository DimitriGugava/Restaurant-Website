## Installation

To use this application, first clone the repository to your local machine. Then, in the project directory, run:


# npm install

This will install all the necessary dependencies for the application to run.

## Usage

To start the application, run:

# npm start


This will launch the application in development mode, and you can view it in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Features

- Reservation form: Allows users to enter their reservation details, and the data is saved to local storage.
- Responsive design: The website is optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens, so users can access it from any device.
- React Router: Enables seamless navigation between different pages of the website.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can also run the following scripts:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you're ready for it.

## Next Steps

While this project uses local storage to save Reservation data, future iterations will include a backend for storing data in a more secure and scalable manner. Additionally, the next project will be built with TypeScript to take advantage of its additional type safety and modularity.
